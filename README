This is the official repository for the Minecraft Map Deleter / Pine Tree Generator.

All and all I don't have much time to work on this project plus I want to work on others as well.
So if you download and use it, I hope it suites your needs,
If you download and modify it, have fun and remember to document the changes.

If you do make a change to the program and upload it to Git Hub please include a build of it.
It would be best not to have just the source and if someone wants to use the program have to build it themselves.

I ask everyone to be kind to each other and I don't want to have people "claim" code and put their name on certain chunks.
This can make it daunting to someone who wants to change or fix existing code if it's associated with a name.
However I do want everyone to be recognized for his or her work so I have made an Authors file so please put your name in that
as well as what you did.

If you need to contact me for any reason feel free to reach me at cstebs@gmail.com
